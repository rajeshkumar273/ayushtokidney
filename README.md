Kiran Kumar Reddi and Usha Rani Rella
Abstract In the present geographical conditions and increased urbanization, the soil
and groundwater are contaminated with excessive fluorine solvents. The fluorinated
water causes serious kidney problems, it’s the need of the hour that man affected by
kidney failures should be made aware of the reason behind the disease and how the
proceedings of the life time could battle the failure environment of kidney, how
much amount water and other intakes of food, body rest, etc. should be carried out
for life time. The expertise data science model can perform and accomplish the task
of suggestion and clears all the fears. Thus making the intelligent model incorporated
by data science and expert systems are combined work for ayush to kidney. The data
science models helps in diagnosis of kidney diseases, reason for failure and measures
of cure through “Data Science Advisory System”. We built an intelligent data science
model to diagnose and advise the patient through expertise information about
kidney life extension and its nurturing in a healthy way.

8.1 Introduction
Our Vedas depicts that the five elements called pancha bhootas form the basic
creation of universe. These are ‘air’ waste release by lungs, ‘fire’ waste through
liver, ‘water’ waste through kidney. The kidney as an excretory organ serves the
human system in performing the homeostasis. Nephron is the basic structural and
functional unit of the kidney. Its chief function is to regulate the concentration of
water and soluble substances like sodium salts by filtering the blood, reabsorbing
what is needed and excreting the rest as urine. It has more than one million

nephron’s that are on duty continuously. Manocha [1] experimentally proved that
the mammal that take water containing 5 ppm fluoride shows Cyto-chemical
characteristics that effects the kidney functionality and toxic addition to the body
[1]. Fluoride intake crossing the optimal range 0.7–1.2 mg/L water causes renal
structure change decreases to downfall tabular function and forms a primary lesion
that leads to disturbance to water processing of the kidney [2]. The water processing
of the nephron is given in Fig. 8.1 [3]. The functionalities disturbance is statistically
analyzed and predicted the stones in kidney and paved away to move towards the
machine learning techniques namely c4.5 algorithms, to improvise the prediction
rate [4]. The analysis and work nature is carried out by Support Vector Machines in
better accuracy rate and zero absolute error finding.

Early risk AVF failure prediction through supervised techniques clearly given by
Morteza research [5] in predicting the probability of complication in new
hemodialysis patients AVF Arterio Venous Fistula (AVF) surgery.
The water processing of a nephron flow diagram gives a clear picture how
necessary to the filtration blood and fluid contents of human body essentialities. The
National Kidney Foundation in its ‘Position Paper on Fluoride—1980’ as well as
the Kidney Health Australia express concern about fluoride retention in kidney
patients. They caution physicians to monitor the fluoride intake of patients with
advanced stages of kidney diseases [6]. The objective of this study is to extract the
patterns of the kidney disease patient record and sample with new model of feature
extraction using data science and soft computing techniques.
The second objective is to advise the patient for life time self-conscious of
maintain food, life activities in a systematic manner that increase the ayush line of
kidney. There is no effective evidence to summarize or suggestion fluoride water as
a cause but it is reframed in 1998, as CKD Chronic Kidney Disease with fluorination
effect. The question is whether the fluorinated drinking water causing CKD
or not. In information visualization the Self-Organizing Map and SVM is an
amazing tool [6]. Through mathematical analysis of the algorithm the fundamental
implementation is simple and easy to understand the map allegory. In machine
learning, SOM and SVM are supervised learning models with associated learning
algorithms which examine the data and recognize patterns. Also, used for the
analysis of classification and regression. The SOM and SVM training algorithm
frames a model and manufacture it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier.
8.2 Methodology
The data science is utilized to provide the e-patient record and remedies by AtoK
model.
The basic contributions are
1. To detect the reason for kidney failure due to fluorosis in Krishna district.
2. To Analyze and estimate the severity of kidney failure through the data mining
techniques namely support vector machine.
3. To frame the data of patient by an expert system, and advisory record using Soft
Computing Tools.
4. This advisory record or information sheet should help the patient to follow himself
in regard of food, intake of medicines, health consciousness maintenance etc.
Water soluble fluorine is not just hazardous but is dangerous for the next generation
kidney functionality [7]. The identified information is the excessive levels of fluoride
comprised normal water results in disturbance towards the normal functionality
associated with critical parts of human body particularly the teeth, kidney, thyroid and
bones. The optimal fluorine soluble should be in a range of 0.7–1.2 mg/L water. As
the areas of Krishna district ground water is crossing these levels, the researchers have

taken the position of nurturing palm through the soft computing—Data science, to
build an intelligent model to “Diagnose And Advise” through educating the patient
with hands on expertise information about kidney life extension and its nurturing in a
healthy way. This is a serious problem because the shadows of the epidemic are
viewed as chronic and the people are unable to accept even to get a female from the
areas like Duganaputtaga of mandasa district to be their bridal partner. It’s a small
attempt to overcome this state for Krishna state in before [8, 9]. The earliest statements

making the kidney health disturb.
8.3 Model Defined
In the process of identifying a positive decision we have moved with a novel
combination of SVM along with Decision making System namely namely ID3
Algorithm. This particular work combination is followed in 4 phase manner.
1. Prediction Driven.
2. Model evaluation process.
3. Decision Interpretation model.
4. Impact of phases.
Figure 8.2 presents a data science model through combinations along with SVM
decision tree ID3 Algorithm would give an intuitive exploration of strategies for
decision making process. Based on above criteria, this model takes the job of
prediction driven by support vector machines, Model evaluation process by ID3
decision support system, and the Decision Interpretation and diagnoses activity by
expert system.
The Input data set forming with different attributes forms a separable leading
symptoms and factors for the disease cause. The unnecessary limitations or so

called uncertainty are covered-up or subject to avoidance [10]. This leads to a better
decision making process. A novel combination of SVM with Decision Support
System (DSS) is studied finally and presented in the proposed work. This combination
follows three phased operations via. Predictor driven, agent evaluation and
interpretation decision [11]. Such combination gives intuitive exploration and work
out on uncertainty that occur before taking a decision.
This work has carried out the analysis and modification of existing models like
SOMs, SVMs etc., and proposed their implementations for disease prediction. The
existing algorithms have been suitably modified either in the form of preprocessing
the inputs, deciding the optimal topology of the network or training the network in
binary. There is not much work that has been done on CKD prediction using the
kind of combination of algorithms proposed. Hence, it is felt that this is a solid
contribution in the field of Data science prediction. Rise of kidney ailment cases

8.3.1 AtoK Model Alias Computational Intelligence Model
This is the model ensemble to rejuvenate the kidney, and report produced by an
expert system AtoK Model is one of the best estimate models to oversee errand
movement in procedure of desire and reporting (expectation). It utilizes data on
expense, and work execution to set up the present status of the task. By system for a
preprocessing the data it permits the data appraisal to extrapolate current cases on
the endeavor result. This is as for health information Analysis. The work plots the
essential measures of the system and dissects its late modification gone for
enhancing reliability in portraying task status, growing farsighted point of confinement,
and considering the catastrophe control [12]. For this the taken stage is
Computational Intelligence, a Statistical Learning figuring can see how to perform
essential errands by summing up from frameworks [13, 14]. As more data finds the
opportunity to be accessible, also yearning issues can be dealt with. Computational
Intelligence expansive utilized as a bit of fragile preparing, making profitable
machine learning applications obliges a worthy measure of “faint workmanship”
that is precarious in examining samples [15]. The data science for health of kidney
as prominent work in the field of intelligent expert system models striving to satisfy
the process of identification domain and the attributes associated traverse towards
disease specific system that advise the next coming days life of kidney [16]. The
decision tree is usually a composition that also includes actual node, branch as well
as leaf node. Every single central node refers to a analyze upon capability, just
about every branch refers to the result connected with test and just about every leaf
node supports the particular course tag. The particular topmost node from the tree
could be the actual node. The decision tree tactic can be more robust pertaining to
classification issues.
