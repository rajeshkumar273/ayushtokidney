            <h2>Specific Gravity- sg</h2>
            <h4>Range: 1.000-1.025</h4>
            <p>Specific gravity measures the kidney's ability to concentrate or dilute urine in relation to plasma. Because urine is a solution of minerals, salts, and compounds dissolved in water, the specific gravity is greater than 1.000. The more concentrated the urine, the higher the urine specific gravity. An adult's kidneys have a remarkable ability to concentrate or dilute urine. In infants, the range for specific gravity is less because immature kidneys are not able to concentrate urine as effectively as mature kidneys.

Glucose, protein, or dyes used in diagnostic tests excreted into the urine increase the specific gravity.</p>
<br><p> If none of these abnormal substances are present in the urine, there are two primary reasons why the kidney is producing concentrated urine with a high specific gravity. The first and most common reason for an increase in urine specific gravity is dehydration. The second reason for a high specific gravity is an increased secretion of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). ADH causes increased tubular water re-absorption and decreased urine volume. Trauma, stress reactions, surgery, and many drugs cause an increase in ADH secretion.</p>

          <h2>Hypertension- htn</h2>
          <h4>Range: 0 or 1</h4>
          <p>Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against blood vessel walls as your heart pumps out blood. High blood pressure NIH external link, also called hypertension, is an increase in the amount of force that blood places on blood vessels as it moves through the body.

</p>
<br><p>High blood pressure can constrict and narrow the blood vessels, which eventually damages and weakens them throughout the body, including in the kidneys. The narrowing reduces blood flow.

If your kidneys’ blood vessels are damaged, they may no longer work properly. When this happens, the kidneys are not able to remove all wastes and extra fluid from your body. Extra fluid in the blood vessels can raise your blood pressure even more, creating a dangerous cycle, and cause more damage leading to kidney failure.

          <h2>Hemoglobin- hemo</h2>
          <h4>Range: 0-18</h4>
          <p>Maintaining higher hemoglobin levels in patients with chronic kidney failure increases the risk for death and for serious cardiovascular reactions such as stroke, heart attack, or heart failure.” Similarly, the 2007 NKF update of the Hb target recommendation states that, although the lower limit of the target Hb range remains 11 g/dl, the target range is 11–12 g/dl, and patients who are receiving an ESA should maintain an Hb target that is ≤ 13 g/dl.23</p>
<br><p>Anemia, as defined by the NKF, is a hemoglobin (Hb) concentration < 12 g/dl for women and < 13.5 g/dl for men.3 Conversely, the European Best Practices Guidelines for the Management of Anemia in Patients with Chronic Renal Failure defines anemia according to age and sex. Anemia is defined as an Hb concentration of < 11.5 g/dl in women, < 13.5 g/dl in men ≤ 70 years of age, and < 12 g/dl in men > 70 years of age.4</p>

          <h4>Range: Yes =1, No=0</h4>
          <p>Diabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how your body uses blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is vital to your health because it's an important source of energy for the cells that make up your muscles and tissues. It's also your brain's main source of fuel.</p>
          <br><p><b>Includes Diseases:</b>Diabetes mellitus type 2<br>

            <h2>Albumin- al</h2>
            <h4>Range: 0-5</h4>
            <p>Albuminuria is a sign of kidney disease and means that you have too much albumin in your urine. Albumin is a protein found in the blood. A healthy kidney doesn’t let albumin pass from the blood into the urine. A damaged kidney lets some albumin pass into the urine. The less albumin in your urine, the better.</p>
<br><p> A urine albumin level that stays the same or goes down may mean that treatments are working. Treatment that lowers the urine albumin level may lower the chances that kidney disease will progress to kidney failure.

People who have diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, or a family history of kidney failure are at risk for kidney disease. Talk with your health care provider about how often you should get a urine test for albumin.

          <h4>Range: Good =1, Poor=0</h4>
          <p>The progressive decline of glomerular filtration rate in chronic kidney disease patients is associated with a significant reduction in food intake. <b>Approximately one third of chronic dialysis patients complain of a fair or poor appetite </b> and this is related directly to poor patient outcomes.</p>
          <br><p>Appetite regulation involves the gastrointestinal tract (ghrelin as an appetite stimulant, and cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide-1, and neuropeptide YY as appetite inhibitors); the adipose tissue with leptin, a potent appetite inhibitor; the vagal system; and the brain, which integrates the stimuli in the hypothalamus area.</p>

          <h2>Red Blood Cell Count</h2>
          <h4>Range: in Millions/cmm</h4>
          <p><b>A red blood cell (RBC) count is a blood test that tells you how many red blood cells you have.</b> 

            Red blood cells contain a substance called haemoglobin, which transports oxygen around the body.
            
            The amount of oxygen that's delivered to your body's tissues depends on the number of red blood cells you have and how well they work.</p>
          <br><p>A RBC count is usually carried out as part of a full blood cell (FBC) count.

            Women usually have a lower RBC count than men, and the level of red blood cells tends to decrease with age.</p>
            <br><p><b>A normal RBC count would be:</b><br>
             <i><b><mark> men – 4.7 to 6.1 million cells per microlitre (cells/mcL)</mark></b></i><br>

          <p>There is enough medical evidence worldwide to prove that there is a direct connection between high fluoride levels in drinking water and kidney disease</p><br>
        <p>Due to water–rock interactions in aquifers, ground water is predominantly fortified with this highly electronegative element, sometimes as high as 15%, depending on the geochemistry of the surrounding area.1–3 Fluoride in water can easily make its way to human and animal bodies through the consumption of fluoride-tainted water and through diet.</p>
